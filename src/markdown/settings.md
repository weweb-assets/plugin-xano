# How to configure the Xano plugin

## Configuration

To start working with Xano data in WeWeb, we invite you to:

- paste your [Xano Metadata API key](https://docs.xano.com/metadata-api):
- select the Xano instance you want to connect
- add the custom domain of your instance (if you have one)
- select the workspace you want to connect

## Advanced settings

Additionally, depending on your use case and Xano plan, you may choose to work with different Xano data sources and branches:
- in the WeWeb Editor,
- in your app in staging, and
- in your app in production.

You may also decide to configure global headers at plugin level here or when you create a Xano collection.

Learn more about these advanced settings [here](https://docs.weweb.io/plugins/data-sources/xano-data.html).
